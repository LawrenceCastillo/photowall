# Photowall

The Photowall app is a result of completing the online course: [The Complete React JS & Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-js-redux-course-build-modern-web-apps/). The course teaches React and Redux, with Firebase to persist data.

If forking this repo, please see Firebase notes in src/Database_template for setting up and connecting Firebase database. For obvious reasons, I have not included my Firebase configuration settings.

1. Fork the repository
2. git clone [link]
3. cd into folder
4. npm install
5. Set up Firebase database
6. npm start
